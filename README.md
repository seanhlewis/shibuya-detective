Shibuya Detective is an exciting murder mystery where you play the role of a detective uncovering the dark plot behind rampant murders that have been occurring.

You will be flung headfirst into the streets of Shibuya after being rescued from drowning in the night by a local fisherman. Amnesia surrounds what happened that night, and how exactly you found yourself in this town. You know one thing, that you're a detective, and that the people need your help to find the ruthless Shibuya murderer. 

With the aid of the townsfolk as well as your own wit, embark on a profound story-driven quest solving puzzles and fighting off yakuza to accomplish your goal. You will make many friends, and foes, along the way. It is up to you who will be by your side when you uncover the true mystery behind the Shibuya murders.

Shibuya Detective is the most complex branching storyline game I have made, so if you love multiple routes and different endings, you will enjoy the game. I hope that you will have as much fun playing and enjoying it as I have!
